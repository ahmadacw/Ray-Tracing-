This is a simple ray tracer, it takes an input text file which describes the scene and outputs a png image of the calculated scene.
The program takes two paths, one to a scene description file and one to an output path for the image.
there are also two optional integer arguments that dictate the size of the output image.

to see the output of the program go to the file called scenes there you will see two files.
one labled [X] and the other [X]Out, [X] is the description of the secene and the other is the output.
